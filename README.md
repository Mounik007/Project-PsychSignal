# Project-PsychSignal
The project was created with an intention of determining if there will be a change in price for the current day based on the data collected over a period of more than 2 years. Logistic regression and decision tree were used in the experimentation to get the best possible results.
The files "psych_sig_log_reg_*.py "  & "psyc_sig_dec_tree_*.py" indicates logisitc regression, decision tree and the version indicates the various parameteres and experiments done on them.



More details on them will be updated soon.
